            <h2>Who is Eager Tom?</h2>
            <p> Eager Tom (née Thomas Mark) Eldridge is many things to many people. He grew up in Sheffield, England,
                where he spent his formative years, enjoying school, climbing in the Peak District and playing music.
                Aged 18 he moved to Bristol to study physics, got involved in the university's climbing and
                mountaineering society UBES, partied hard and made friends for life. He spent his third year studying
                in Darmstadt, Germany, taking his high-school German to nearly fluent levels, before moving back to the
                UK to finish his undergraduate degree and begin postgraduate research in meteorology. </p>
            <p> In 2021, motivated by a desire for new challenges and to keep up his German, he took a job in St Gallen,
                Switzerland. Although he sometimes chafes against certain cultural differences, he enjoys his time here
                and the opportunity it affords him to spend more time in the mountains, and has ultimately decided to
                stay, although his work is no longer in the same town.</p>
            <p> Eager's professional skills lie somewhere in between scientist and software developer. He's a rational
                sort, and likes to do things rigorously, but he's not that interested in the minutiae of modern physics,
                preferring applied maths for modelling real-world scenarios. </p>
            <p> Another thing that sets him apart from your stereotypical nerd is his breadth-not-depth approach.
                He has many interests, and a diverse array of friends. He also has a dry, quirky sense of humour and
                enjoys indulging himself in jokes which others might think have run their course. </p>

            <h2>Offer him a job?</h2>
            <p> Now over the hill, Eager realises his wildest days are behind him. Recently, he's been taking his career
                more seriously, strengthening his professional skills, and working on a variety of personal software
                projects. Although he hopes you'll be interested in him as a whole person, he'd point you to the
                <a href="software.html">software</a> portion of this website if you'd like to see some examples of what
                he's capable of.</p>

            <h2>Listen to his music?</h2>
            <p> Eager learnt to play classical music from an early age, and developed a real passion for listening to
                many kinds of music as he grew up. He's now interested in writing and producing his own music.

            <h2>See what he's been up to?</h2>
            <p> Eager likes to keep it interesting in his spare time. As well as the projects mentioned above, he stays
                active by cycling, climbing and running, he travels occasionally, and he participates in cultural events
                both at home and abroad. </p>

            <h2>Hear his thoughts on the world at large??</h2>
            <p> Through listening to podcasts, reading books and simply chatting with friends, Eager likes to think he
                maintains a balanced yet nuanced perspective, with some genuinely different and interesting ideas thrown
                into the mix. <a href="musings.html">Perhaps you'll agree?</a></p>
